# MY PHP CRUD Application

This repository hosts a working PHP CRUD application. This is a public repository so please download and try out the application.

#### Project Overview
Design and develop dynamic data-driven web applications using server-side scripting and relational databases. Apply both client-side and server-side validation and data cleansing techniques. Deploy, configure and test a web application on a remote server using FTP/SFTP.

### Instructions
* Create a MySQL database called php-crud in PHP MyAdmin
* Run the code in the data-for-your-database.txt file in PHP MyAdmin
* Move the PHP files in to your htdocs folder so Apache can process the PHP code
* Configure the database.php file to connect to your SQL database
